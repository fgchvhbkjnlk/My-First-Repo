The player can control Mysha using the right and left arrow keys to move horizontally. Pressing the space bar allows Mysha to jump.
The primary goal is to collect all the tokens within each level before the time limit expires. Tokens appear as collectible items represented by various objects.
As the player completes each level, they advance to the next one. However, failing to collect all tokens within the time limit results in level failure.
Each level has a set time limit within which the player must collect all tokens. If the time runs out, the level fails.

Yasmin:

My duties included doing the coding for the player primarily and working with/providing support for Hannah during of her coding of the tilemaps. I based the coding for the player class and collision functions on Hugh Hammond’s code but made changes to it (such as adding collectible interactions (with Hannah’s help)). I also commented on the whole code once it was complete, to demonstrate my understanding of Hugh’s original code. Regarding player movement, I added the code that flips the player sprite gif depending on the player's direction on the x-axis. Regarding the tilemaps, I helped Hannah code levels and level transitions by using different tilemaps/graphicmaps/tilerules arrays and the ‘level’ variable. I also played a role in debugging some parts of the code, such as editing the graphicmap/tilerules arrays to be proportional to the size of the canvas.

XinMeng (Hannah):

My job is to include the coding for the tilemap primarily and work providing support for Yasmin during her coding of the player. I have coded based on the coding for the tilemap collision detection algorithms that were implemented to accurately detect and resolve player interaction with the tilemap, ensuring smooth movement and gameplay. Based on understanding the code on Hugh Hammond’s I expanded the gameplay area, which allows to set three different level’s platforms making the game more interactive and increasing the difficulty. I help Yasmin to update tile graphics and rules for each level to offer different gameplay experiences. As well as enhanced the player movement mechanics for smoother controls and jumping behavior. I’ve managed to set three different levels with varying layouts and collectibles. When a player in each level touches the collectible the collectible disappears.

Sophie:

In our group project, I was responsible for coding the timer for the game. It would stop at 45/30/20 seconds (depending on the level) and trigger a fail screen if the player didn’t complete the level in time. At first, we had just one timer for the prototype however as we continued to work on the game, we decided to add different time limits for each level to make it more interesting for the player. Additionally, since the prototype, I wrote the code for the audio including background music and success and fail music effects to help enhance the overall player experience.

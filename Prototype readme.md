•	Our game follows the main character, Mysha, throughout her day, with each level being a third of the day (morning, afternoon and evening/night). On each level, the player has to collect Mysha’s daily necessities, for example breakfast, within the time limit in order to progress to the next level. The first level will feature Mysha at home in the morning gathering supplies to get ready for the day, the second level will see her at university gathering supplies for study and the third level will return to her home where she relaxes and gets ready for bed. 
•	In our game, we intend to explore the following themes: stress, responsibilities and self-care. The theme of stress will be showed through the use of the time constraints on each level. The theme of responsibility will be represented through the task of gaining all the necessities. Lastly, the theme of self-care will be represented through the use of meals and socialising as necessities to collect in the game.
